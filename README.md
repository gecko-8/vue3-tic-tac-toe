# vue3-tic-tac-toe

This project demonstrates building a simple Tic Tac Toe game using the Vue3 Options and Composition APIs.

## Notes

* Project uses [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/).
* All game/turn logic is handled in the Game component. The Board and Marker components are simple stateless components responsible for displaying the board and markers respectively.
